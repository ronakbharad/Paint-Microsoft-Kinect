Kinect as a Teaching Tool in Computer Science
Lucie, Ronak, Jessica, Vivek

Materials
1 Kinect per two or three students.
All the resources available here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6mi04xeswve47jf/AABXDLfKqp23cVog5N7R0snua

Setup
1. Each PC should have the following installed (all available from the link above):
OPENNI-Win32
KinectSDK
Processing 2.1.2 (32 or 64 bit okay)
2. (This step may need to be done by hand on each machine) Setup SimpleOpenNI as follows:
	a. Press start-> Type “Processing” -> Hit enter.
	b. Sketch > Import Library > Add Library
	c. In the “Filter your search…” text box, enter: “Kinect”
	d. Click on SimpleOpenNI, and click “Install.” Once it installs, you can close that window.
3.  Plug in each Kinect’s power and connect to a Windows PC via USB. 

Students perform these steps:
4. In processing, open and navigate to the “Provided Code/SimpleKinectExample” folder. Open SimpleKinectExample.pde
5. Run the program.

(Note: we have never had any bugs with any of these steps so far, so we don’t have any troubleshooting tips at this time)

Lesson plan:
1. Refresher of processing/ how to call methods on an object (10 minutes)
2. Introduction to EasyKinect through demo and runthrough of simple program (10 mins)
3. Allow students 40 minutes to experiment with EasyKinect and see what it offers. (40 mins)
4. Introduce KinectPaint program. (10)
5. Allow students to either
 a) continue their existing project, knowing that we, the organizers may or may not be able to solve every problem they run into, or 
b) Work on adding on to KinectPaint
(1 hour)
6. Lunch break (1 hour?)
7. Continue step 5 (40 mins)
8. Discussion/wrap up/presentations?


Purpose of lesson/Points we want to get across (talk about these in discussion):
Even the most complicated devices can be interfaced with in simple ways through the power of abstraction. 
Computer science allows you to work with something as complicated as the kinect (which has two cameras and an infrared range-detector!) without knowing how it actually works. You can imagine that with a clean enough interface, you could give instructions to a car (Google’s new self driving cars) or even a house.
Computer science can be very abstract, but it can also interact with the real world in very direct ways.


How to include SimpleKinect in a Processing sketch:
1. Create a new sketch and save it as normal.
2. Sketch > Add File > SimpleKinect.pde
SimpleKinect is now a part of this program and you have all of its functionality.
